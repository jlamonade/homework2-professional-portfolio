# Homework 2-Professional Portfolio

Repo for homework 2

I built this page using a mobile first design pattern where all elements are justified in a column. When the screen reaches 768px or above, it responds by changing the content's display to inline-flex which lets the headers of the content sections to go to the left and the contents of those sections to go on the right creating a more desktop website feel.
The header nav also reacts to a screen width of 768px or higher by justifying its contents to flex-end. The link hover effect for nav links and contact icons are achieved by lowering the opacity of the link to 70% when the cursor hovers over them. The project hover effect is achieved by increasing the project screenshot contrast from 60% to 100%.
